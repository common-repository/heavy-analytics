Heavy Analytics is a WordPress plugin used to track content and user statistics.  

We have a lot of ideas to extend this plugin and would love any feedback you have.  Please send feedback to info@heavyanalytics.com and join our email list at http://www.heavyanalytics.com.

This plugin will be best used on blogs or single site WordPress communities with lots of comments and/or authors.  Our goal is to give community managers another tool to determine who the power users and influencers are in their community.

While it currently only provides data for single site WordPress installations, we have BuddyPress and Multi-site addons in the works!

Coming soon!
